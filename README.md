My personal ChimeraX files that range from plant viruses to biopolymers.
The plant viruses are  for a school project, and the biopolymers are made just for fun. 
All files are meant to be opened in ChimeraX with the standard open function.
Chimera commands are simply meant to make the molecule viewable in its entirety with relative ease. Building on this, I would like to implore users to explore Chimera's multitude of functions and commands to build their own molecular structures and build upon the ones I have released.
All of my sources for the molecules are from RCSB'S Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/)
